                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Make the patties: Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saut√© mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into mushroom mixture until combined.</li>
                <li>Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until simmering. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy has thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
